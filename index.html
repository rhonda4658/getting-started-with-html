 <p> RHONDA'S NOTES</title></p>
 <p></p><b>HTML</b> is<em>Hypertext Markup Language</em>

<p>HTML</b> is made up of <p>text content</p> <br>markup</br> <br>reference to other documents</br><br> links and videos

<div><br> The major pieces of programming are you, your computer (browser), the internet and servers</br>
<div>HTML is made up of tags. There is an opening tag, elements, and closing tag</div>
<br>It would be difficult to remember all the tags, but an easy way to research tags </br>
is to use <a href="http://WWW.google.com">Google </a>
</br>

<br>I think before I complete this course, I will be spending a great deal of time
<br> on <a href="https://Udacity.com"> Udacity</a> 

<p>I am having a hard time with the anchor tag linking to the actual website.</p>
<p>It appears to create the link, but it will not open the website</p>
<p>I am going to have to <b>research</b> this in great depth.</b></p>

<br>Some of the more popular tags are</br>
<p><em>img</em> which is used to add images to a webpage</p>
<p><em>br</em> which is used to start a new line</p>
<p><em>b</em> which is used to make text bold</p>
<p><em>p</em> which creates a paragraph form</p>
